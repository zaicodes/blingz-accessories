### Typography

The project utilizes the following Google Fonts: with

- Jost
- Prata
  The Jost font is applied to buttons, the navbar, and price and p tags, while Prata is used exclusively for all headings and titles.

### Images

I used Midjourney to create pictures of models wearing jewelry and to generate photos of jewelry products for the shop page.
For the logo design I used Canva to design the logo of the website.
