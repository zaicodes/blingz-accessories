## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a responsive and dynamic webpage that showcases accessories for the popular fashion brand, Blingz.
Blingz offers a diverse collection of curated, handcrafted jewellery with a user-friendly interface and detailed descriptions for informed choices. The site ensures effortless cart management, allowing seamless updates and personalised profiles for swift checkouts.
With a responsive design, Blingz provides a consistent and enjoyable browsing experience across devices.

### Target Audience

Blingz targets fashion-forward individuals with a passion for jewellery. 
This audience, keen on curated and elegant pieces, values user-friendly features like detailed descriptions, effortless cart management, and personalized profiles for quick checkouts. 

## User Experience (UX)

### Client Goals

As a first-time visitor, I want to:

- Easily navigate through the website which is responsive to different screen sizes.
- See clear and detailed product pages with high-quality images, pricing, and product descriptions.
- Easily create a user account to track my orders.
- Read reviews and ratings from other customers to make informed purchasing decisions.

As a returning user, I want to:

- Log in quickly and securely using my existing credentials.
- Effortlessly add items to my shopping cart for a seamless shopping experience.
- Have the ability to update the cart, adjust quantities, and remove items before proceeding to checkout.


As a frequent user, I want to:

- Have multiple ways for contacting customer support, including a contact form for written queries and find and utilize contact information, such as phone numbers and email addresses, for more urgent inquiries.
- Change my password and username easily from the account settings page.
- Ability to delete the profile account.

## Design

### Wireframes

During the planning stage, I used Balsamiq for crafting the wireframes.
Click [here](https://github.com/zaicodes/blingz-accessories/tree/main/documentation/wireframes) to access them.

### Colour Scheme

![Colour Palette](https://github.com/zaicodes/blingz-accessories/blob/main/documentation/colour-palette.png)

### Typography

The project utilizes the following Google Fonts: with

- Jost
- Prata
  The Jost font is applied to buttons, the navbar, and price and p tags, while Prata is used exclusively for all headings and titles.

### Data Model

A data model was created to outline how users will interact with the application.

![Data-Schema](https://github.com/zaicodes/blingz-accessories/blob/main/documentation/data-schema.png)


The above diagram represents users and their shopping carts. Here's a brief overview of the relationships:

#### User:

- Each user object contains attributes such as _id, username, email, and password.
_id uniquely identifies each user.
- username and email represent the user's login credentials.
- password stores the hashed password for user authentication.

#### Shopping Cart:

- The cart array within each user object represents their shopping cart.
- Each item in the cart has attributes like name, price, imgSrc, and quantity.
- name and price denote the product's name and price respectively.
- imgSrc stores the path to the product image.
- quantity indicates the quantity of each item added to the cart.

#### Relationships:

- Each user can have zero or more items in their shopping cart.
- Users are identified uniquely by their _id.
- The user's _id is referenced within each item in the shopping cart to associate items with specific users.
- This schema allows users to add items to their shopping carts, with each user having their own set of items. The relationships between users and their shopping carts are established through the _id field.


### Security:

A number of different security considerations were taken into account when developing the project.

#### env.py file: 

Sensitive information like DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY are stored in a .env file, which is excluded from version control to prevent exposure.

#### Defensive Programming:

- The site employs defensive measures to restrict unauthorized actions.
- For instance, users who aren't signed up or logged in can't access access the checkout process, enforced via @login_required decorators.

#### Password Hashing:

- User passwords aren't stored as plaintext but are hashed using the token_hex() function.
- This function is part of the secrets module in Python, which is used for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, and security tokens.

#### Input Validation:

- The system checks for existing emails to prevent duplicate registrations.
- Length validation for password ensures sufficient complexity.
- During registration, users confirm passwords by entering them twice, triggering an error if they don't match.

#### Feedback to Users:

- Flash messages provide feedback on user actions, such as successful logins or authentication failures.
- Feedback messages avoid overly specific errors to enhance user experience, opting for more generalized messages like 'Email does not exist' or 'Incorrect password'


### Images

I used Midjourney to create pictures of models wearing jewelry and to generate photos of jewelry products for the shop page.
For the logo design I used Canva to design the logo of the website.

- ARIA roles and labeled form fields improved dynamic content accessibility.
- Rigorous testing, including user feedback, validated the commitment to exceeding accessibility standards for an inclusive and enjoyable user experience.

## Technologies and Frameworks

### Technologies used:

- HTML5 - to create the structure of the site.
- CSS3 - to add styling to the site.
- JavaScript + JQuery - to add functionality.
- Python with flask - for backend development.

### Libraries, frameworks and other useful websites:

- Git - for version control.
- Gihub - to store the project's code after being pushed from Git.
- Visual Studio Code - to code my project
- Lighthouse - to test the accessibility of the website
- Am I responsive? - To present the website image on a different devices.
- Google Dev Tools - to test features, and responsiveness and to troubleshoot.
- Balsamiq - to design the wireframes of the project.
- Fontawesome.com - to get icons for the website
- Favicon.io - to generate tab icons for the website
- cloudconvert - to convert images from png or jpg to webp.
- img2go.com - to resize images to any size.
- Coolors - to generate colour palette for the website
- Google fonts - to get typography with free, customizable fonts.
- Canva - to design the logo.
- Midjourney - to create all the photos used across the website.

### Databases and API

The project has self-created data API as well as curd functionality been implemented through MongoDB:

- I generated a dataset using a JSON file to establish the shop, a strategy employed to steer clear of hard-coding the entire store. 

- Additionally, I integrated MongoDB by connecting it through MongoDB Compass, enabling me to monitor the feedback for each stored, deleted, or updated data.

- Upon user signup process, their details such as username, email, and password are stored. Subsequently, when the user initiates a checkout, the acquired items are recorded in their order history, which is stored in the database under their respective user profile.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment


The website is deployed using Heroku. To initiate the deployment on Heroku, you need to create two essential files: a requirements.txt file and a Procfile.

The requirements.txt file enumerates all the necessary applications and dependencies required for running the app. Generate the requirements.txt file by executing the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```

The Procfile informs Heroku about which files run the app and how to execute it. Create the Procfile using the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    echo web: python app.py > Procfile
    ```

Note: The Procfile uses a capital P and lacks a file extension.

Ensure the Procfile has the Heroku logo next to it after creation. Additionally, check the contents of the Procfile, as a blank line may be inadvertently added at the end during creation. This extra line can potentially cause issues during deployment, so delete it if present and save the file. Save both files, then add, commit, and push them to GitHub.

Next, log in (or sign up) to Heroku.com. Click on the "New" button and then select "Create New App."

Provide a unique name for your app (as names must be unique) and select a region. Once done, click "Create App."

Connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository for the site. Under the deployment section, choose GitHub, locate the correct repository for the project, and click "Connect."

Once the repository is connected, you need to supply Heroku with the necessary config variables to build the app. Navigate to the "Settings" tab, and click the "Reveal Config Vars" button. Add the environment key/value variables used in the env.py file:

    | KEY | VALUE |
    | :-- | :-- |
    | IP | 0.0.0.0 |
    | PORT | 5000 |
    | SECRET_KEY| YOUR_SECRET_KEY* |
    | MONGO_URI | MONGO_URI* |
    | MONGO_DBNAME | MONGO_DB* |


*Denotes values specific to your app.

Note that the debug is set to true for detecting bugs on the live site; remember to change it to FALSE after deployment.

Finally, enable automatic deploys and click the "Create" button. Heroku will commence building the app.
