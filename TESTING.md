Continuous testing was an integral part of the entire development process. I relied on Chrome developer tools to identify and resolve issues as they arose during the development phase.

Throughout the development, Google developer tools were instrumental in verifying the proper functioning of various elements and troubleshooting any unexpected behavior.

I also leveraged the developer tools' console to carefully assess specific sections of JavaScript, ensuring that the code performed as intended and to troubleshoot any encountered issues.

To guarantee responsiveness across a variety of screen sizes and devices, I meticulously examined each page using both Google Chrome developer tools and the Firefox inspector tool.
