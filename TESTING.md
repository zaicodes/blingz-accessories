Contact form:
I conducted thorough testing on the contact form, both locally and on the published website, to verify its functionality. Testing included scenarios such as submitting the form with empty fields. The form consistently guided users to complete missing information, and use the @ symbol for email. Clear instructions were provided for missing or incomplete submissions, leading users to successfully submit the form. Upon successful submission, the form shows an alert to the users ensuring an instant confirmation.

## Automated Testing

### W3C Validator

I used [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate both the HTML and CSS on all pages of the website.

- HTML W3C Validator
Regarding the HTML Validator, it flagged information messages about trailing slashes on void elements, a result of the automatically added /> close tag by Prettier. 
Manual removal will be addressed in the next file save to rectify this issue.
it also flagged the flask related codes which was ignored.
other than that, there were no errors found.

![index.html]()

- CSS Validator (JigSaw)
The CSS Validator Jigsaw was used to validate all the CSS files. There were no errors found.
![style.css](https://github.com/zaicodes/blingz-accessories/blob/main/documentation/testing/jigsaw.png)

### JavaScript Validator

[JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) was used to check for any errors in JavaScript code. There were none found.

### Lighthouse

Google's Lighthouse tool was used to test performance, accessibility, SEO,
and PWA aspects of the site. The results are as follow:

Issues found on Lighthouse:

- The contrast ratio between the background and foreground colours is inadequate, particularly with the dark pink text on a white page. This was ignored as these colours were part of colour palette for this project.

- Another concern was that the link tags lacked a distinguishable name. Despite adding "aria-label" to address this, the profile icon in the navbar also has "aria-hidden='true'." This adjustment is necessary to accommodate variations in the icon appearance for users who are logged in versus those who are not logged in.

## Bugs discovered

During development and deployment I noticed a few bugs that needed fixing.

### Solved bugs
- Lighthouse index.html > needed to give alt attributes to images in Testimonials, also needed to change the button that said SEE MORE into more specific name i.e. Our journey as it was too generic. 
- Lighthouse Contact.html > the iframe had no name so I gave it a title attribute of my-map and reduced the space between the iframe and the section title.
- Profile+cart icons were added to smaller screens by placing their icons in the middle of the navbar through css.
- Fixing the profile deleting functionality in database by incorporating the functionality within a form, using a button with name and value attributes, and ensures proper event handling by correctly invoking the confirmDeleteProfile function with parentheses in the onclick attribute.
- limited the python code to 79 ch. max, and added more comments to explain the code and functions further.
- Fixing add to cart functionality which wasn't working and not linking to profile. This was fixed by introducing a new /checkout route for handling the checkout process and streamlines the profile update logic by incorporating it into the existing /profile route.
- Added the missing alt attributes and title for better accessibility, resizing logo so it's more clear.
- Fixed error with config file which wasn't working on heroku. This was solved by changing the file name to env.py


### Unsolved bugs
- in the lighthouse, the accessibility scored 88% on some point, this was due to using aria-hidden on navbar icon to flexibly control it. Implementing aria hidden can enhance the accessibility of various elements, including decorative icons or images, which in my project's case was necessary.
